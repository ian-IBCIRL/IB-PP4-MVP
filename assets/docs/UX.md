### The Skeleton Plane
#### Wireframe mock-ups

Home page: The home page provides the user with a clear understanding as to the purpose of the site. 
There is a clear call to action for the user to search for a vehicle post with the search bar at the top of the home page. 
I did not implement the search function or the user profile, as these were not required for the MVP PP4 criteria.
The welcome message is clearly visible to the user when they first see the site, using any device.

Initial public images were sourced from https://www.pexels.com/search/car/

I used PostgreSQL relational database management system for this app.
The model diagram below visually represents the structure of a PostgreSQL database, including tables, columns, relationships, and constraints, that is actually stored in the database itself.
